    <p class="lesson">
        Ever bought something online? Logged into a website? Withdrew money from an ATM? You've relied on cryptography
        to keep your information safe. But how does it work and where did it come from? Cryptography has a long
        and rich history extending from at least 600 BCE to the present. From simple monoalphabetic substitutions to
        quantum cryptography, it's saved lives and doomed others, started and ended wars, and been an area of intense
        study for the cryptanalysts that work to break ciphers.

        This website was created to provide an overview of cryptography throughout the ages in a concise, engaging way.
        Use the tabs above to navigate to important milestones in crypto-history. Following each short lesson
        are puzzles or mini-games to exercise your new understanding of cryptographic techniques.
