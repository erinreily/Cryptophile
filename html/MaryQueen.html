            We'll take a break from the encryption and decryption for a short history lesson. Beginning with her inheritance
            of the Scottish throne at six days old, Mary Queen of Scots had a tumultuous life, with multiple marriages, several unsuccessful
            attempts to secure her rule over Scotland, all ending with her last eighteen and a half years imprisoned
            by Queen Elizabeth, her cousin. During her captivity, she remained active and sent and received multiple encrypted letters 
            to contribute to the Babington Plot, a plan to assassinate Elizabeth. Unfortunately for Mary, her
            cipher wasn't strong enough-- her letters were intercepted and decrypted, which eventually led to 
            her beheading. Had her cipher been more effective, she would have had grounds to defend herself.
            A good cipher is really important!
