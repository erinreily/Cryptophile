# Cryptophile

Cryptophile is a website built to teach the basics of cryptography in a concise and engaging way. Each topic typically features a short lesson and a corresponding exercise to accomodate different styles of learning. The topics it currently covers go over the early stages of cryptography, from its predecessor steganography through the cipher of Mary, Queen of Scots. 
Inspiration for Cryptophile was taken from "The Code Book" by Simon Singh.

This project was developed during CodeRED: Curiosity in October 2016 at the University of Houston.
