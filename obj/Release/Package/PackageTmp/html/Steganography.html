            Steganography was the precursor to cryptography. While cryptography makes a message difficult to read 
            without knowing the cipher, steganography simply hides the message. This works to a certain degree; as long
            as no one but the intended recipient knows about the message, the secret is safe, but if the existence of the
            message is revealed, anyone can read it. In ancient history, people hid their messages in various ways. One way was to tattoo
            the message onto a shaven head, let the hair regrow, and shave it again when the carrier reached the 
            destination. Another was to etch a message into a tablet or other such surface and cover it with wax.

            Although steganography has its drawbacks, it does have an advantage over cryptography. Where an encrypted 
            message might draw attention and interest--thereby increasing the chances of it being broken--a concealed 
            message is easily overlooked. Modern steganographic techniques include making text the same color as the 
            background in documents/emails/web pages.
